### Overview

This architecture aims to create a self-managed Kubernetes cluster that is cloud-agnostic and can be deployed on any infrastructure. It includes control plane and worker nodes, networking, storage, security, and monitoring/logging. The environment will be based on **Ubuntu 24.04** and use **Kubernetes v1.30.3**.

### Architecture Components

1. **Infrastructure Layer**

   - **Virtual Machines (VMs):** 
     - **Control Plane Nodes:** Minimum of 3 VMs for high availability, each running one compute instance of the control plane components. 
     - **Worker Nodes:** Scalable number of VMs, based on application demands.
     - **Private Network:** Securely connect all VMs within a private network to ensure communication only between internal components.

   - **Load Balancer:** 
     - Used to distribute traffic among control plane nodes for API server requests, ensuring reliability and high availability.

2. **Operating System**

   - **Ubuntu 24.04:** 
     - Chosen for its stability, long-term support, and compatibility with Kubernetes.
     - Ensure that the OS is up-to-date with the latest security patches.

3. **Kubernetes Components**

   - **Control Plane Components:**
     - **API Server:** 
       - Acts as the central management entity, exposing Kubernetes API. All administrative tasks are sent to the API server.
     - **Controller Manager:** 
       - Runs controllers to ensure that the cluster's current state matches the desired state.
     - **Scheduler:** 
       - Assigns work to nodes based on resource availability and other constraints.
     - **etcd:** 
       - A distributed key-value store to store cluster state data. Clustered for high availability and performance.

   - **Worker Nodes:**
     - **Kubelet:** 
       - An agent that runs on each worker node and ensures containers are running in a Pod.
     - **Kube-proxy:** 
       - Maintains network rules on nodes and allows network communication to your Pods.
     - **Container Runtime:** 
       - Use `containerd` for running containers due to its simplicity and integration with Kubernetes.

4. **Networking**

   - **Pod Networking:**
     - Use a Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin like Calico or Cilium for efficient networking between pods.
     - Provides network policies for pod security and performance.
     
   - **Service Networking:**
     - Handles internal communication between services using ClusterIP.
     - Use NodePort or LoadBalancer types for external service exposure.

   - **Ingress Controller:**
     - Use an NGINX ingress controller for routing external traffic to services within the cluster.

5. **Storage**

   - **Container Storage Interface (CSI):**
     - Provides a standard interface for Kubernetes to interact with different storage providers.
     - Use persistent volumes (PV) and persistent volume claims (PVC) for managing storage resources.
     - Ensure dynamic provisioning of storage with a default storage class.

6. **Security**

   - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
     - Manage permissions with fine-grained access control to resources within the cluster.
   
   - **Network Policies:**
     - Implement policies to control the communication between pods and restrict traffic where necessary.

   - **Secrets Management:**
     - Use Kubernetes Secrets to store sensitive information, such as passwords, tokens, and keys.
     - Consider integrating with a secret management tool like HashiCorp Vault for enhanced security.

7. **Monitoring and Logging**

   - **Monitoring:**
     - Deploy Prometheus to monitor cluster health and performance metrics.
     - Use Grafana to visualize metrics and set up alerts for critical conditions.

   - **Logging:**
     - Implement an ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to collect, process, and visualize logs.
     - Ensure centralized logging to capture logs from all cluster components for auditing and debugging.

8. **High Availability and Scalability**

   - **Control Plane High Availability:**
     - Ensure control plane nodes are distributed across different failure zones.
     - Use a load balancer to route requests to healthy API server instances.

   - **Scalability:**
     - Implement Horizontal Pod Autoscaler to scale pods based on resource utilization.
     - Use Cluster Autoscaler to automatically adjust the size of the cluster based on current workloads.

9. **Backup and Disaster Recovery**

   - **etcd Backups:**
     - Regularly backup etcd data to restore cluster state in case of failure.
   
   - **Disaster Recovery Plan:**
     - Implement a plan to recover from failures, including regular testing of backup and restore processes.

### Deployment and Management

1. **Provisioning:**
   - Use infrastructure as code (IaC) tools like Terraform to automate the provisioning of VMs and networking components.

2. **Configuration Management:**
   - Use tools like Ansible or Puppet to automate the configuration and deployment of Kubernetes components.

3. **CI/CD Integration:**
   - Integrate with CI/CD tools to automate application deployment and updates within the Kubernetes environment.

4. **Updates and Maintenance:**
   - Regularly update Kubernetes components and nodes to the latest versions to ensure security and performance.
