# Database Deployment for Sample Backend

To deploy a database for the sample backend application, I would use the following approach:

## Database Selection
I would choose PostgreSQL for its robustness and widespread use.

## Tools
- **Helm**: To deploy the PostgreSQL database.
- **Kubernetes Secrets**: To manage sensitive information like database credentials.

## Deployment Steps
1. **Add the Bitnami Repository**:
   ```bash
   helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami

2. **Install PostgreSQL**:
   ```bash
   helm install my-postgresql bitnami/postgresql

3. **Configuration**:
   - Configure the database connection parameters in the application's Helm Chart.
   - Kubernetes Secrets to securely store and manage database credentials

## Why My Approach?
- **Scalability**: PostgreSQL because it can handle a wide range of workloads.
- **Ease of Use**: Bitnami's Helm Chart to simplify the deployment.
- **Security**: Using Kubernetes Secretes ensures sentitive data is protected.
